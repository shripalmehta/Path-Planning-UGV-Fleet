    "\n",
    "### Task locations\n",
    "\n",
    "For `job`, `pickup` and `delivery` objects, if custom matrices are\n",
    "provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `location_index` is mandatory\n",
    "- `location` is optional but can be set to retrieve coordinates in the\n",
    "  response\n",
    "\n",
    "If no custom matrix is provided:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a `table` query will be sent to the routing engine\n",
    "- `location` is mandatory\n",
    "- `location_index` is irrelevant\n",
    "\n",
    "### `vehicle` locations\n",
    "\n",
    "- key `start` and `end` are optional for a `vehicle`, as long as at\n",
    "  least one of them is present\n",
    "- if `end` is omitted, the resulting route will stop at the last\n",
    "  visited task, whose choice is determined by the optimization process\n",
    "- if `start` is omitted, the resulting route will start at the first\n",
    "  visited task, whose choice is determined by the optimization process\n",
    "- to request a round trip, just specify both `start` and `end` with\n",
    "  the same coordinates\n",
    "- depending on if custom matrices are provided, required fields follow\n",
    "  the same logic than for `job` keys `location` and `location_index`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Capacity restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Use amounts (`capacity` for vehicles, `delivery` and `pickup` for\n",
    "jobs, `amount` for shipments) to describe a problem with capacity\n",
    "restrictions. Those arrays can be used to model custom restrictions\n",
    "for several metrics at once, e.g. number of items, weight, volume\n",
    "etc. A vehicle is only allowed to serve a set of tasks if the\n",
    "resulting load at each route step is lower than the matching value in\n",
    "`capacity` for each metric. When using multiple components for\n",
    "amounts, it is recommended to put the most important/limiting metrics\n",
    "first.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is assumed that all delivery-related amounts for jobs are loaded at\n",
    "vehicle start, while all pickup-related amounts for jobs are brought\n",
    "back at vehicle end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skills\n",
    "\n",
    "Use `skills` to describe a problem where not all tasks can be served\n",
    "by all vehicles. Job skills are mandatory, i.e. a job can only be\n",
    "served by a vehicle that has **all** its required skills. In other\n",
    "words: job `j` is eligible to vehicle `v` iff `j.skills` is included\n",
    "in `v.skills`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition implies in particular that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- a task without skills can be served by any vehicle;\n",
    "- a vehicle without skills can only serve tasks with no particular\n",
    "  need (i.e. without skills as well).\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to ease modeling problems with no skills required, not\n",
    "providing a `skills` key default to providing an empty array.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task priorities\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful in situations where not all tasks can be performed, to gain\n",
    "some control on which tasks are unassigned. Setting a high `priority`\n",
    "value for some tasks will tend as much as possible to have them\n",
    "included in the solution over lower-priority tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task setup times\n",
    "\n",
    "Setup times serve as a mean to describe the time it takes to *get\n",
    "started* for a task at a given location. This models a duration that\n",
    "should not be re-applied for other tasks following at the same\n",
    "place. So the total \"action time\" for a task is `setup + service` upon\n",
    "arriving at a new location or `service` only if performing a new task\n",
    "at the previous vehicle location.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time windows\n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to users to decide how to describe time windows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **relative values**, e.g. `[0, 14400]` for a 4 hours time window starting at the beginning of the planning horizon. In that case all times reported in output with the `arrival` key are relative to the start of the planning horizon;\n",
    "- **absolute values**, \"real\" timestamps. In that case all times reported in output with the `arrival` key can be interpreted as timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The absence of a time window in input means no timing constraint\n",
    "applies. In particular, a vehicle with no `time_window` key will be\n",
    "able to serve any number of tasks, and a task with no `time_windows`\n",
    "key might be included at any time in any route, to the extent\n",
    "permitted by other constraints such as skills, capacity and other\n",
    "vehicles/tasks time windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vehicle `steps`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In plan mode\n",
    "\n",
    "The `steps` array describes exactly the route ordering that will be\n",
    "generated in response. The (optional) `service_*` keys for\n",
    "`vehicle_step` objects are used as additional hard timing constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In solving mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Using `steps` for vehicles in default VRP solving mode is a way to\n",
    "force starting the search from the matching user-defined solution, if\n",
    "valid. Unlike the default solving behavior of running several\n",
    "concurrent searches, this means in particular that a single search\n",
    "path is followed, starting from the provided solution. Resulting\n",
    "quality is thus obviously expected to be highly dependent on the\n",
    "user-defined starting point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In that context:\n",
    "- only steps with `type=job`, `pickup` or `delivery` are used to\n",
    "  decide initial routes ordering\n",
    "- `service_*` keys are not used\n",
    "\n",
    "An error is raised if for any of the vehicles the provided `steps`\n",
    "describe a route that is invalid with regard to any of the\n",
    "constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "The `matrices` object allows to input (non-empty) custom matrices for\n",
    "each vehicle profile. Each matrix is an array of arrays of unsigned\n",
    "integers filed under the `profile` key, then under:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `durations` for a custom travel-time matrix that will be used for\n",
    "  all checks against timing constraints;\n",
    "- `distances` for a custom distance matrix;\n",
    "- `costs` for a custom cost matrix that will be used within all route\n",
    "  cost evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "If only the `durations` matrix is provided, internal costs are derived from\n",
    "durations based on vehicles `costs` properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of describing different matrices for different vehicle\n",
    "profiles:\n",
    "\n",

    "optional. Instead of the coordinates, row and column indications\n",
